    <p>Thorns are used by these organisms to serve the main purpose of defense</p>
    
    <p>This website is to educate people about the different types of animals bearing these thorns, or in other words, the animals who are feeling thorny;)</p>
    <p>I plan on having a page for each of the five animals listed about describing in detail the animal and its habits. </p>
    <p>A target audience for the site is anyone who is interested in wildlife specifically with thorns.</p>
